I have created a C# utility app to monitor Windows processes and kill the processes that work longer than the threshold specified. The command line utility expects three arguments: a process name, its maximum lifetime (in minutes) and a monitoring frequency (in minutes, as well). When the program runs, it starts monitoring processes with the frequency specified. If a process of interest lives longer than the allowed duration, the utility kills the process and adds the corresponding record to the log. When no process exists at any given moment, the utility continues monitoring (new processes might appear later). The utility stops when the 'Q' keyboard button is pressed.   

Here is the example: monitor.exe notepad 5 1 â€“ every other minute, the program verifies if a notepad process lives longer than 5 minutes, and if it does, the program kills the process. Additionaly, I have covered the code with NUnit tests that I found necessary for this program.
